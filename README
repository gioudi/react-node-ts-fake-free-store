# react-node-ts-fake-mercado-libre

Hi there!

I hope you are doing well. In this project, you can find a software solution that consumes the MercadoLibre API and displays a list of products based on the customer's search.

For the backend, I used Node.js and Express, besides for the frontend, I used React and Redux. As a developer always looking to improve the code quality, I have integrated TypeScript and ESLint as well.
